This is a simple web app I was instructed to make as a part of the application process for App Annie. It takes your geolocation (if accessible) and shows the weather forecast for the rest of the day. It is available to view at http://alexsheehan.co/weathurly/ and http://alexsheehan.co/weathurly/index2x.html
